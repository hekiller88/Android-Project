# Android-Project

## Intro

These are the bunch of practice projects for learning Android Development.

Enviroment
  - Android Studio
  - Java
  - SQLite DataBase


## Installation

  Since Android Studio will automatically generate lots of files. 
  
  I only include the most import files which are located in `../app/src/main`.
  
  These files included
    - AndroidMainfest.xml
    - Java Files (modulo part)
    - Resouce File(picture, sounds, layout...)
