# Android-Project

## Intro

These are the bunch of practice projects for learning Android Development.

Enviroment
  - *Android Studio*
  - *Java*
  - *SQLite DataBase*


## Installation

Since Android Studio will automatically generate lots of files. 
  
I only upload the most import files which are located in `../app/src/main`.
  
These files includes: 
- *AndroidMainfest.xml*
- *Java Files* (Modulo part: in responsible for logic & computing)
- *Resouce File* (View part: picture, sounds, layout...)
