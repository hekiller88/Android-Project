# Android-Project

## Intro

These are the bunch of practice projects for learning Android Development.

Enviroment
  - __Android Studio__
  - __Java__
  - __SQLite DataBase__


## Installation

Since Android Studio will automatically generate lots of files. 
  
I only include the most import files which are located in `../app/src/main`.
  
These files includes: 
- AndroidMainfest.xml
- Java Files (modulo part)
- Resouce File(picture, sounds, layout...)
